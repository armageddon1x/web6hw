//Javascript and jQuery

/*Javascript is powerful but can be overwhelming. 
however, there are libraries of functions premade so 
that it is easier to implement JS into web pages. one
library is jQuery, which can be included into the 
html head as an external source. this library is held
in a CNS (content deliery network) with an absolute 
path*/

//how does a jQuery function look like?

//call
//$()
/*this is the way to call jQuery functions. the $() is 
actually the main jQuery function that contains the 
library. by using the $(), you can call other functions
as well*/

//add document
//$(document)
/*elements to be used by the function go inside the
parentheses. the elements are in CSS syntax*/

//$("body");
//$("#icon");
//$(".thing"); 

/*Javascript is an object oriented language, so it 
manipulates objects. the Document Object Model 
(DOM) is a standard that helps with interaction with 
objects and using HTML elements as objects. jQuery 
uses this to select basically any HTML element and 
manipuate it easily.*/

//check if document is ready
//$(document).ready()

//add anonymous function
//$(document).ready(function(){
			//thing to be done
			//});
